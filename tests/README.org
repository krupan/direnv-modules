* Testing

Tests will generally need to be written as shell scripts.  Let's stick with POSIX syntax just to be sure they'll run everywhere.  Starting each test with:

#+begin_example
#!/bin/sh
#+end_example

and running shellcheck on the test will make sure of that.

Tests should be named in the form test-feature.

Common functionality needed by multiple tests should go in =test-funcs=.

Using =set -e= at the start of each test script is strongly recommended.

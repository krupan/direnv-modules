* Testing

Tests will generally need to be written as shell scripts.  Let's stick with POSIX syntax just to be sure they'll run everywhere.  Starting each test with:

#+begin_example
#!/bin/sh
#+end_example

and running shellcheck on the test will make sure of that.

Tests should be named in the form test-feature.

Common functionality needed by multiple tests should go in =test-funcs=.

Using =set -e= at the start of each test script is strongly recommended.

direnv creates a file every time dm loads or unloads a dmodulfile (it's part of the direnv security model).  This creates a race condition in our test scripts.  To prevent this, =test-funcs= has begin_direnv and end_direnv functions that you need to wrap every dm load or unload call with.  See =test-unload= for an example of this.  *However*, this isn't solving the problem completely.  Stay tuned.
